# room-activity-scan
Project to develop an IoT room activity monitoring system (Health/Wellness Monitoring) using multiple sensors for detecting presence, movement, air quality, and sound, e.t.c. The aim is to achieve much with little. The system will use MQTT for data transmission and includes relay control for potential room automation.
